# Weed-Removal-Robot
DEVELOPING A ROBOT THAT CAN IDENTIFY AND  REMOVE WEEDS FROM FIELDS, REDUCING THE NEED FOR HERBICIDES.

The Weed Removal Robot project aims to develop a simple and eco-friendly automated 
system to assist in weed removal for agricultural applications. The primary objective is to 
reduce manual labor and minimise the use of chemical herbicides by employing a mechanical 
weed removal approach. The system operates through controlled movement and a motor-driven cutting mechanism that removes weeds from the soil surface. Wireless control enables 
flexible operation of the robot during field use, allowing precise movement and activation of 
the cutting mechanism. The robot is designed to navigate across flat agricultural surfaces and 
perform weed removal through user-controlled operation. Emphasis is placed on low cost, 
simplicity, and ease of implementation, making the system suitable for small-scale farming 
applications. Experimental testing conducted under controlled conditions demonstrates 
effective weed removal with reduced human effort. The results indicate that the system can 
perform basic weed removal tasks efficiently while promoting environmentally sustainable 
farming practices. Overall, the project successfully demonstrates a practical and economical 
solution for mechanical weed removal, contributing to improved productivity and reduced 
environmental impact in agricultural operations.
